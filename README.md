# Causal Graph
## Breast Cancer Causal Inference

Breast cancer is the cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. This form of cancer occurs mostly in women and rarely in men
Some of it symptoms are a lump in the breast, bloody discharge from the nipple and changes in the shape or texture of the nipple or breast.

There are some features which are known to be causing breast cancer, as given in the data https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data. However, the general
assumption is that there might be some underlying factors that causes breast cancer and might not be easily known from any observational or experimental data.
The main objective of the task is to highlight the possibility of that assumption and establish a ground truth.

This is an attempt to solve the problem using the follow methods:
<ul>
  <li>Perform a causal inference task using Pearlâ€™s framework;</li>
  <li>Infer the causal graph from observational data and then validate the graph;</li>
  <li>Merge machine learning with causal inference;</li>
</ul>
